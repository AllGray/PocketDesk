## Introducing _**PocketDESK**_

What is _**PocketDESK**_?.

PocketDESK is a way to run the normal _Desktop GUI_ on your _PocketCHIP_ without any hassle. 

_Does the keyboard work?_  **Yes sir**

_Does the touchscreen work?_  **Yes sir**

_Can i run this next to the normal PocketHome?_ **YES SIR**


The install is super simple.

Just run

    sudo apt update && sudo apt install git

    git clone https://github.com/AllGray/PocketDesk.git

    sudo ./PocketDesk/PocketDesk.sh

That is it. Do a reboot and you are good to go.

## How to use!


The point of **_PocketDESK_** is that you can switch between the normal **Desktop GUI** and **PocketHome**

To do this simply log out of whatever you booted into

**PocketHome:** (_See.. I put a button there for you'all_)

**Desktop:**

In the login manager you click and choose the desired **GUI** version:
